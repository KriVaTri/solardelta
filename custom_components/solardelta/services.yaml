# SolarDelta registers services per config entry dynamically.
# No global services are declared here.
# Per-entry service names (registered at runtime) are:
# - solardelta.reset_avg_session_{entry_slug}
# - solardelta.reset_avg_year_{entry_slug}
# - solardelta.reset_avg_lifetime_{entry_slug}
# where {entry_slug} is the slugified entry name.
