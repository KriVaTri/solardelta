# SolarDelta (this is a beta version and a project in progress)

[![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/KriVaTri/solardelta?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/KriVaTri/solardelta/releases)

Home Assistant custom integration that compares solar production with a device’s consumption and exposes four percentage sensors per entry (coverage + three persistent averages):
- Coverage percentage: how much of a device’s consumption is currently covered by solar.
- Rounding: values are shown with 1 decimal, except exact 0% or 100% (no decimals).
- Negative power values are treated as 0.
- Conditions: calculation only occurs when both status and trigger entities match the configured strings.
- This integration is mainly focused on EV charging consumption, but can be used for other devices. In case of EV charging, the status sensor would be the charging status of the EV or wallbox, this is usually "charging". The trigger sensor can be a sensor detecting if the vehicle is connected to the wallbox, this is usually "on". These strings can be anything but they are case sensitive and must match the sensor or binary_sensor status string exactly. If no trigger sensor exist, the status sensor can be used and its string instead.

Configuration (via UI):
- Name: a custom label for this entry; the entity will be named “solardelta <Name>”.
- Solar sensor: select your solar production sensor (sensor).
- Device sensor: select your device consumption sensor (sensor).
- Status entity: an entity (sensor or binary_sensor) representing the device status.
- Status match: a string to match against the status entity’s state (case-insensitive).
- Trigger entity: an entity (sensor or binary_sensor) to trigger on.
- Trigger match 1: required string to match against the trigger entity’s state (case-insensitive).
- Trigger match 2: optional second string to match.
- Scan interval (seconds): 0 = disabled (push-only updates); >0 adds periodic recalculation at the given interval.

Behavior:
- Push updates: listens to changes of solar, device, status, and trigger entities.
- Optional polling: if scan interval > 0, it also recalculates on that schedule.
- If conditions fail, the sensor reports 0%.
- Units (W vs kW) are normalized automatically.

Average sensors (persistent):
- solardelta <Name> avg session: time‑weighted average; holds when conditions drop; resets when the trigger changes to the first trigger string (provided during configuration) e.g. "on" from any known state.
- solardelta <Name> avg year: time‑weighted average; holds when conditions drop; auto‑resets on New Year (local time). Also resettable via service solardelta.reset_avg_year.
- solardelta <Name> avg lifetime: time‑weighted average; holds when conditions drop; never resets. Resettable via service solardelta.reset_avg_lifetime.
- If an entry or the integration has been deleted, reinstalling the integration and/or an entry with the same name, will restore its previous data.

Active duration attributes (on each average sensor):
- What it is: the total elapsed “active” time (in seconds and DD:HH:MM) that contributed to that sensor’s average.
How it behaves: increases only while conditions are allowed (the same periods used to compute the average), and resets exactly when that average resets (session trigger, New Year, or the relevant reset service).
- What it is not: it’s not wall‑clock time since the sensor was created; periods when conditions aren’t met do not count.

Changing settings later:
- Use Configure on the integration to change sensors/strings and scan interval.
- The Name cannot be changed after initial setup. If you need a different name, delete the entry and create a new one or change it's friendly name.

Installation:
- Through HACS: add a custom repository. (https://github.com/KriVaTri/solardelta)
- Or copy the `custom_components/solardelta` folder into your Home Assistant config.
- Restart Home Assistant.
- Settings → Devices & Services → “Add Integration” → SolarDelta.
